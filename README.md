## Description
The logo generator takes user input to develop a new logo.svg file. This application uses Inquirer and Jest to create the new logo. When the user runs the command "node index.js" in the command line, they will be asked a series of questions that will help them create their new logo. These questions include: shape, shape color, text, and text color. Once they answer all of the questions, the new logo.svg file will be created and the new logo can be viewed in the browser.

## Installation

In order to run this application, ensure that Inquirer and Jest are installed. Then to begin the program, you enter "node index.js" into the command line.

To begin working on this project, my instructor provided an instructional video that provided us with some code to get started. I also worked with my tutor when I was getting stuck.
